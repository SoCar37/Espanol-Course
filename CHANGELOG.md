Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)

## [Unreleased]

## [0.7.8] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed
- Lesson tables now render correctly — added `remark-gfm` plugin to `LessonPage.jsx`. Previously markdown tables displayed as raw pipe characters; they now render as styled HTML tables across all units.

## [0.7.7] - 2026-03-17

### Removed
- Exercises tab removed from main nav (Layout.jsx) and fallback route removed from App.jsx — exercises are accessed through the lesson flow only (Lesson → Exercises → Quiz)

## [0.7.6] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed
- Flashcards — pronunciation hint now hidden until card is flipped to Spanish side, preventing it from giving away the answer on the English front face

## [0.7.5] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- Exercise scoring bug — score now reflects first-attempt correctness only. Previously, retrying a wrong answer and eventually getting it right would count as correct, inflating scores. The retry UI is unchanged; only scoring is affected.
- Fix applied consistently across all four exercise types: MultipleChoice, FillInBlank, Translation, SentenceAssembly
- ExerciseEngine now passes `onAdvance` prop to exercise components so correct retries still advance without re-scoring

## [0.7.4] - 2026-03-16

### Changed
- `FlashcardsPage.jsx` — global due queue replaces per-unit default. Flashcards now loads vocab from all completed units (`complete: true`) and surfaces whatever is due across all of them. Units unlocked by placement test but not completed (`placementUnlocked` only) are excluded. Empty state shown when no units are complete yet.

### Fixed
- Flashcard nav button no longer silently defaults to A1 Unit 1 regardless of user level

## [0.7.3] - 2026-03-16

### Changed
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` rewritten for public launch — corrected exercise schema examples (fill_in_blank and translation now show correct 4-option + integer answer format), removed outdated branching workflow, updated project structure to reflect all 56 units complete, added two-location content serving note, added schema rules table

## [0.7.2] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- Removed duplicate placement test prompt from `Layout.jsx` — prompt now appears only on the course map (`CourseMapPage.jsx`)

## [0.7.1] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- Placement test no longer marks lower-level units as `complete` — they are now marked `placementUnlocked` only, so users don't see false ✅ badges on units they never did
- `CourseMapPage.jsx` — all 5 `isAvailable` checks now accept `placementUnlocked` in addition to `complete`, so the sequential unlock chain still fires correctly after placement

## [0.7.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- Placement test — 35 MCQ questions spanning A1–B2 (`PlacementTestPage.jsx`)
  - Scores into A1 (<40%), A2 (40–59%), B1 (60–79%), or B2 (≥80%)
  - Unlocks all units below placed level; user starts fresh at placed level
  - Intro screen, per-question feedback, and result screen with placed level + score
- `useProgress.js` — `unlockLevel(level)` and `setPlacementComplete(level)` functions
- `App.jsx` — `/placement` route
- `Layout.jsx` — placement banner shown on all pages until test is completed
- `CourseMapPage.jsx` — placement prompt card shown at top of course map until test is completed
